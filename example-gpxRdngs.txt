The example files illustrate the use of gpxRdngs.py on a GPX file produced by a SatMap GPX 
device. The walk was a short walk of under 3 miles in length. The GPX file exported from the 
SatMap device (150807sm-grouseInn.gpx) was 321kB in size and had 2903 way-points.

The console screen output generated by running the gpxRdngs - h command is given in 
gpxRdngs-help.txt.

The console screen output (gpxRdngs-console.txt) shows the extended summary statistics produced 
by using gpxRdngs to analyse the GPX file.

The file (fullOutput.txt, 80kB) generated by running the gpxRdngs -i150807sm-grouseInn -vbsx 
-ofullOutput.txt command includes the equivalent compact (374 way-points) GPX data and bar 
separated value fields (including latitude, longitude, elevation, timestamp & National Grid 
Reference values for each way-point) and the summary statistics modified to take into account a 
further 58 way-points discarded because the horizontal distance between them was less than the 
deafult Tolerance L value of 5 metres. The compact GPX data on its own would generate a file of 
50kB, compared to the original 321kB GPX file.
